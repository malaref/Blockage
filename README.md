# Blockage: Block a page!

This is a simple Chrome extension to block (or auto-redirect from) specific pages.

All the extensions I could find on the Chrome Store block whole websites. For some websites, this is not an option for me and I want to only block (or auto-redirect from) specific pages rather than the whole website. So, I decided to write a one myself.

Currently, the pages are hard-coded into [`background.js`](https://github.com/muhammad-alaref/Blockage/blob/master/background.js). I am not planning to publish this (at least not any time soon). However, for the sake of completion, I may add an options panel and a pop-up for it later.
